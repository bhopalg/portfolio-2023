This is my first time using MDX with Next.js, this is a fun adventure setting it up.

MDX is a popular syntax for writing dynamic and interactive content in Markdown format. With the integration of MDX, Next.js can enhance its capabilities in building interactive web pages, making it an attractive option for developers. In this tutorial, we will be covering the process of adding MDX to Next.js with TailwindCSS, a popular utility-first CSS framework.

The blog assumes that you have a basic understanding of Next.js and TailwindCSS. If you are new to Next.js, you can check out the [official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) to get started. If you are new to TailwindCSS, you can check out the [official documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) to get started.

    Step One
</Header>

Install the following dependencies:

<CH.Section>
    <CH.Code>
        ```bash terminal
        yarn add @mapbox/rehype-prism @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react @next/mdx remark-gfm
        ```
    </CH.Code>
</CH.Section>

<Header>
    Step Two
</Header>

Update the `next.config.js` file to include the following:

<CH.Section>
    <CH.Code>
        ```js next.config.mjs
        import nextMDX from '@next/mdx'
        import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'
        import rehypePrism from '@mapbox/rehype-prism'

        /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
        const nextConfig = {
            pageExtensions: ['ts', 'tsx', 'mdx'],
            reactStrictMode: true,
            experimental: {
                scrollRestoration: true,
            },
        }

        const withMDX = nextMDX({
            extension: /\.mdx?$/,
            options: {
                remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
                rehypePlugins: [rehypePrism],
            },
        });

        export default withMDX(nextConfig)
        ```
    </CH.Code>
</CH.Section>

Here we are wrapping `nextConfig` with the `withMDX` function, which will allow us to use MDX in our Next.js application.

We also add `remark-gfm`, a plugin for remark that adds support for GitHub Flavored Markdown. We also add `@mapbox/rehype-prism`, a plugin for rehype that adds support for syntax highlighting.

<Header>
    Step Three
</Header>

One of the cool features of MDX with can use React components in our Markdown files. To do this, we need to create a `components` folder in the root of our project. Inside this folder, we will create a `layout.tsx` file, which will be our layout for the blogs.

<CH.Section>
    <CH.Code>
        ```tsx components/layout.tsx
        import { Container } from "@/components/container";
        import { Prose } from "@/components/prose";
        import { formatDate } from "@/lib/format-date";
        import Head from "next/head";
        import { useRouter } from "next/router";

        function ArrowLeftIcon(props: any) {
            return (
                <svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" aria-hidden="true" {...props}>
                    <path d="M7.25 11.25 3.75 8m0 0 3.5-3.25M3.75 8h8.5" strokeWidth="1.5" strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" />
                </svg>
            );
        }

        export function ArticleLayout({
            children,
            meta,
            isRssFeed = false,
            previousPathname,
        }: {
            children: React.ReactNode;
            meta: { title: string; description: string; date: string };
            isRssFeed?: boolean;
            previousPathname?: string;
        }) {
            const router = useRouter();

            if (isRssFeed) {
                return children;
            }

            return (
            <>
                <Head>
                    <title>{meta.title}</title>
                    <meta name="description" content={meta.description} />
                </Head>
                <Container className={"mt-16 lg:mt-32"}>
                    <div className="xl:relative py-14">
                        <div className="mx-auto max-w-2xl">
                        {previousPathname && (
                            <button
                                type="button"
                                onClick={() => router.back()}
                                aria-label="Go back to articles"
                                className="group mb-8 flex h-10 w-10 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-white shadow-md shadow-zinc-800/5 ring-1 transition border border-zinc-700/50 bg-zinc-800 ring-0 ring-white/10 hover:border-zinc-700 hover:ring-white/20 lg:absolute lg:-left-5 lg:mb-0 lg:-mt-2 xl:-top-1.5 xl:left-0 xl:mt-0"
                            >
                                <ArrowLeftIcon className="h-4 w-4 stroke-zinc-500 transition stroke-zinc-500 group-hover:stroke-zinc-400" />
                            </button>
                        )}
                            <article>
                                <header className="flex flex-col">
                                    <h1 className="mt-6 text-4xl font-bold tracking-tight text-zinc-100 sm:text-5xl">
                                        {meta.title}
                                    </h1>
                                    <time
                                        dateTime={meta.date}
                                        className="order-first flex items-center text-base text-zinc-500"
                                    >
                                        <span className="h-4 w-0.5 rounded-full bg-zinc-500" />
                                        <span className="ml-3">{formatDate(meta.date)}</span>
                                    </time>
                                </header>
                                <Prose className="mt-8">{children}</Prose>
                            </article>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </Container>
            </>
            );
        }

        ```
    </CH.Code>
</CH.Section>

<CH.Section>
    <CH.Code>
        ```tsx prose.tsx
        import clsx from "clsx";
        import { ReactNode } from "react";

        export function Prose({ children, className }: { children: ReactNode; className?: string }) {
            return <div className={clsx(className, "prose dark:prose-invert")}>{children}</div>;
        }

        ```
    </CH.Code>
</CH.Section>

The children of the `ArticleLayout` component will be the content of our blog post. We will also pass in the `meta` object, which contains the title, description, and date of the blog post. We also pass in the `previousPathname` prop, which will be the pathname of the previous blog post. This will allow us to create a back button that will take the user back to the previous blog post.


<Header>
    Step Four
</Header>

Now that we have our layout component, we can create our blog post. Create a new file in the `pages` folder called `pages/articles/my-first-blog.mdx`. This will be the page that will render our blog post.

I'm using this blog post as an example, so I will copy the content of the blog post and paste it into the `my-first-blog.mdx` file.

<CH.Section>
    <CH.Code>
        ```mdx pages/articles/my-first-blog.mdx
        import { ArticleLayout } from '@/components/article-layout'
        import {Header} from "@/components/arcticels/header";

        export const meta = {
            author: 'Gurps',
            date: '2023-02-08',
            title: 'My fun adventure setting up MDX with Next.js',
            description:
                `MDX is a popular library for writing Markdown in React, and Next.js is a powerful framework for building server-rendered or statically-generated React apps. In this blog, we'll show you how to set up MDX in Next.js`,
        }

        export default (props) => <ArticleLayout meta={meta} {...props} />
        ```
    </CH.Code>
</CH.Section>


Here we are setting up metadata for our blog post. We are also importing the `ArticleLayout` component that we created earlier. We are passing in the `meta` object as a prop to the `ArticleLayout` component. We are also passing in the `props` object, which contains the `children` prop. The `children` prop will contain the content of our blog post.


<Header>
    Step Five
</Header>

Now we have our blog post metadata and layout set up, we can start writing our blog post.

One of the cool features of MDX is the ability to write JSX inside of Markdown. This means that we can write our blog post in Markdown, and then add in some JSX to add some extra functionality.

<CH.Section>
    <CH.Code>
        ```mdx pages/articles/my-first-blog.mdx
        <Header>
            Step One
        </Header>

        Install the following dependencies:

        yarn add @mapbox/rehype-prism @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react @next/mdx remark-gfm
        ```
    </CH.Code>
</CH.Section>

As you can see I have a Header component that renders an `h1` tag. I can then apply extra styling to the heading.

<CH.Section>
    <CH.Code>
        ```tsx components/header.tsx
        import { ReactNode } from "react";

        export function Header({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
            return <h1 className={"text-2xl font-bold font-spaceMono"}>{children}</h1>;
        }
        ```
    </CH.Code>
</CH.Section>

<Header>
    Step Six
</Header>

Now time to test it out. Run the following command to start the development server:

<CH.Section>
    <CH.Code>
        ```bash terminal
        yarn dev
        ```
    </CH.Code>
</CH.Section>

This will start the development server on `localhost:3000`. Navigate to [My First Blog](http://localhost:3000/articles/my-first-blog) to see your blog post.

And that's it! You have successfully set up MDX in Next.js.
