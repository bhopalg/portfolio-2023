# Kubernetes
<br/>
Imagine you have a software application. Traditionally, you might run this application on a physical server. However, as your application grows in popularity, one server is no longer enough. You need multiple servers to handle all the traffic. This is where challenges arise: How do you efficiently manage and scale these servers? How do you ensure your application remains available if one server fails? How can you deploy updates without downtime?
<br/>
This is where containerization and Kubernetes come into the picture.
<br/>

## Containers
<br/>
Before diving into Kubernetes, it's essential to understand containers. A container is like a lightweight, standalone executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system. This means that you can reliably run your software anywhere, regardless of the environment. Docker is a popular platform for creating and running containers.

<br/>

## Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s)
<br/>
Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. Think of it as an operating system for your cluster of servers, where the application containers are the apps.
<br/>
Here are some fundamental concepts and features:
<br/>
1. **Nodes**: The machines, VMs, or physical servers that run the containers.
2. **Pods**: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. A pod can host one or multiple containers.
3. **Services**: A way to expose your application, running in pods, to the network or the outside world.
4. **ReplicaSets and Deployments**: These ensure that a specified number of pod "replicas" are running at all times. If a pod or underlying host fails, Kubernetes will start a new pod elsewhere in the cluster to maintain the desired number of replicas.
5. **Auto-scaling**: Kubernetes can automatically scale the number of pods based on CPU usage or other select metrics.
6. **Load Balancing**: Distributes network traffic across a group of servers or pods.
7. **Rolling updates & Rollbacks**: Update the application or its configuration in a rolling manner, ensuring zero downtime. If something goes wrong, Kubernetes provides a way to roll back.
<br/>

## Why is Kubernetes Important?
<br/>
1. **Portability**: Applications in containers can run anywhere â€“ on-premises, in public clouds, and hybrid clouds.
2. **Scalability**: Easily scale up or down based on demand.
3. **High Availability**: Even if some parts of your application fail, others can continue to work.
4. **Efficient resource utilisation**: Pack more applications into a smaller number of servers.
<br/>

## In Summary
<br/>
Kubernetes helps manage and orchestrate containerized applications across a cluster of machines. With its robust ecosystem and community, it provides the tools necessary for high availability, scalability, failover, rollbacks, and more, making it easier for developers to manage and scale their applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
